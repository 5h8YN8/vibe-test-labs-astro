      { question: "What does EMS micro-current feel like?", answer: "A gentle tingling or pulsing sensation on your scalp. It's unusual at first but most people find it pleasant after 2-3 uses." },
      { question: "Is it waterproof enough to use in the shower?", answer: "IPX5 means it handles water jets Ã¢ÂÂ safe for rinsing under the tap and light shower use. Don't submerge it." },
      { question: "How does this compare to the Scalp Massager Comb ($86)?", answer: "This device is $24 cheaper, adds EMS micro-current, has IPX5 waterproofing, and charges faster (1hr vs 2hr). The Comb has a larger 1200mAh battery and comes in 3 colors. Performance is comparable." }
